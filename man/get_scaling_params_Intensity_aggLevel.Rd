\description{
Estimate scaling parameters of a MRC model, where the cascade weights are 
considered to be dependent on the temporal aggregation level 
and on the intensity of precipitation that has to be disaggregated.
In the first step observed weights are calculated for each temporal aggregation level. 
Also at this stage, for each observed precipitation intensity, its index z is calculated.  
Second, MRC parameters are estimated by considering a dependency to 
temporal aggregation level, precipitation intensity class and asymmetry index class z. 
In the last step, scaling models are fitted on estimated MRC parameter by 
the method of linear least square. Plots showing estimated parameters and their scaling models 
are also returned
