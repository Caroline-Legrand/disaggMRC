Description: Micro-canonical Random Cascade is a method for temporal disaggregation of precipitation time series from coarse resolution (e.g. daily) 
             to fine resolution (e.g. 30 minutes). This package provides tools for parameter estimation of this model, estimation of scaling models, 
             with different options for dependency, and tools for disaggregation based on these parameters and dependencies. Possible dependency options 
             are precipitation intensity, temporal aggregation level and precipitation sequence asymmetry. Precipitation data and examples are also 
             provided. The user is invited to refer to this paper for more details on the models.
