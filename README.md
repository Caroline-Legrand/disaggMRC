# MultiplicativeRandomCascade


Micro-canonical Random Cascade is a method for temporal disaggregation of precipitation time series 
  from coarse resolution (e.g. daily) to fine resolution (e.g. 30 min). 
  This package provide tools for parameter estimation of this model, estimation of scaling models, with different options 
  for dependency, and tools for disaggregation based on these parameters and dependencies. 
  Possible dependcy options are: precipition intensity, temoral aggregation level and asymmetery of precipitation sequence.
  Fictive precipition data for a station are also provided.
  The user is suggested to refer to these papers for more details on the models.
